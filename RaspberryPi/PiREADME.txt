We have switched out controller from a raspberry pi pico to an Arduino nano.  This was done because there were no micropython linraries for the LIS3DH Acceleromoter, addtionally, Serial to an SD card was a little more complicated. Thae Arduino Nano is now being employed, and code in the directory is obsolete.
